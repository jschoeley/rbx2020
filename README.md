# Robustness and bias of excess death estimates in 2020 under varying model specifications

Various procedures are in use to calculate excess deaths during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Using weekly death counts from 20 European countries, we evaluate the robustness of
excess death estimates to the choice of model for expected deaths and perform a cross-validation
analysis to assess the error and bias in each model's predicted death counts. We find that the
different models produce very similar patterns of weekly excess deaths but disagree substantially
on the level of excess. The country ranking of percent excess death in 2020 is sensitive to the
exclusion of an exposure variable but otherwise stable across models that do account for population
structure. The five-year average death rate model consistently produces the lowest excess death
estimates, whereas high excess deaths are produced by the popular five-year average death count
and Euromomo models. Cross-validation revealed these estimates to be biased under a causal
interpretation of "expected deaths had COVID-19 not happened."
